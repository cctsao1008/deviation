There are multiple targets available for building the Whippet application:

devo8:  This is the default target for the Walkera Devention 'DEVO8' transmitter
        It requires the gnu arm toolchain including gcc, newlib, and libopencm3
        Here is a convenient script to download and build all components:
           https://github.com/esden/summon-arm-toolchain

emu_devo8: This will build on the native platform (no cross-compiler needed)
           The main purpose of this target is to facilitate GUI development.

the default target is 'devo8'

To build:
