DSM2:

DSM2 data packets consist of 7 channels each.  the packets are formatted as 16bit MSB-1st values
Data can be either 10 or 11 bits.
6-channel DSM2 = 10bit
8-channel DSM2 = 11bit
All DSMx appears to be 11bit

A packet consists of a Tx ID + upto 7 channels of data
each 16bit data value is defined as:
10bit:
a 0 bbbb cccccccccc
11bit:
a bbbb  ccccccccccc

a:    0 for 1st data packet, 1 for 2nd data packet
bbbb: the channel number of this packet
cc..: 10 or 11bit channel data (MSB 1st)

Channel assignment appears to be:
0: Throttle
1: Aileron
2: Elevator
3: Rudder
4: Gear
5: Aux1
6: Aux2
7: Aux3


Data packets are defined as:
aa bb cccc dddd eeee ffff gggg hhhh iiii
aa: If DSM2: 0xff - mfgid[2], if DSMX mfgid[2]
bb: If DSM2: 0xff - mfgid[3] + offset, if DSMX mfgid[3] + offset (see binding)
cccc: Channel
dddd: Channel
eeee: Channel
ffff: Channel
gggg: Channel
hhhh: Channel
iiii: Channel


Each packet is sent twice, once on channel 'a' and 4msec later on channel 'b'
If there are more than 7 channels to transmit, the upper channels are transmitted using the same
packet format 11mec after the the low-channel packet.
New channel data is transmitted each 22msec

For example:
 0msec: Transmit channels 0-7 on channel 'a'
 4msec: Transmit channels 0-7 on channel 'b'
11msec: Transmit channels 8-14 on channel 'a'
15msec: Transmit channels 8-14 on channel 'b'
22msec: Transmit channels 0-7 on channel 'a'

New SOP(8 bytes) and Data (16 bytes) codes are sent before each packet.

Binding:
The bind packet is as follows:
aa bb cc dd aa bb cc dd eeee ff gg hh ii jjjj
aa   : 0xff - mfgid[0]
bb   : 0xff - mfgid[1]
cc   : 0xff - mfgid[2]
dd   : 0xff - mfgid[3] + offset
eeee : 384 + sum of bytes 0 through 7
ff   : Unknown (value = 0x01)
gg   : # of channels being transmitted
hh   : Transmitter capabilities
     : HP6DSM (DSM2): 0x01
     : DX6i   (DSMX): 0xA2
     : DX8    (DSM2): 0x12
     : DX8    (DSMX): 0xB2
     : DM9    (DSM2): 0x02
# of packets (1 if num-channels < 8, 2 if num-channels >= 8) for DSM2
ii   : Unknown (value = 0x00)
jjjj : eeee + sum of bytes 8 through 13
The bind channel can be any odd channel between 0x01 and 0x4f
The SOP and CRC are set as below for the chosen bind channel
the DATA code is 32 bytes.  The 1st 16 bytes are as defined below for the bind channel.
The 2nd 16 bytes are always:
D7A154B15E89AE86 C69422FE48E6574E

Once the Rx detectes that the bind packet is no longer being sent, it
will transmit a confirmation on the same channel using the fillowing 16byte DATA code:
98881BE430790384 060C12181E247110
It is not required that the Tx receives or acts upon this packet

The confirmation data is:
aa bb cc dd ee ff gg hh ii jj
aa: byte[0] of bind packet
bb: byte[1] of bind packet
cc: byte[2] of bind packet
dd: byte[3] of bind packet
ee: byte[10] of bind packet (always 0x01)
ff: # of supported channels(?)
    AR7000=0x07, AR6010=0x07, AR6210=0x07
gg: requested packet type
    AR6210 connected to HP6DSM(DSM2): 0x01 (DSM2 requested)
    AR7000 connected to DX6i (DSMX):  0x01 (DSM2 requested)
    AR6010 connected to DX6i (DSMX):  0xA2 (DSMX requested)
hh: byte[13] of bind packet (always 0x00)

SOP/Data/CRC code selection:
there is one set of SOP, Data, and CRC codes for each transmit channel.
The SOP and DATA codes come from the Cypress recommended SOP table.  the codes are documented here:
http://www.cypress.com/?docID=15229

They are organized in 5 rows of 9 columns with the contenst of each 'cell' being an 8-byte PN code
The row is determined by the transmit channel as:
row = channel modulo 5
The columns are determined from the mfgid as follows:
sop-col = (mfgid[0] + mfgid[1] + mfgid[2] + 2) & 0x07
data-col0 = 7 - sop-col
data-col1 = data-col0 + 1
The crc for channel 'a' is NOT(mfgid[1] << 8 + mfgid[0])
The crc for channel 'b' is (mfgid[1] << 8 + mfgid[0])

Here is the table (note that I've transposed rows and columns to make it easier to read)
Note: Values are LSB 1st
