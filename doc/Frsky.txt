One-way binding:
The binding packets define a list of 50 channels that will
be used in sequence during data transmission.  At least for some
transmitters, these channels are sequential with a uniform spacing of 5,
but this is likely not strictly required.  Channel values of 0 and 1 are
apparently invalid.  From observed data, the 1st channel in the sequence
was 6.
Binding packets seem to be sent until the transmitter is powered down.
Packets are sent every 53.468msec.  There are 10 packets needed to define
the entire sequence, packets repeat once transmission is complete.

Binding packets are sent as follows:
aa bbbb cccc dd ee ff gg hh ii jj kk ll mm
aa:   length of transfer (not including length byte) == 0x0e
bbbb: packet type (?) == 0x0301
cccc: transmitter ID
dd:   starting channel
ee:   channel value for index dd+1
ff:   channel value for index dd+2
gg:   channel value for index dd+3
hh:   channel value for index dd+4
ii:   channel value for index dd+5
jj:   00
kk:   00
ll:   00
mm:   CRC8 of previous 14 bytes (polynomial = 0x07, initial value = 0x93)
