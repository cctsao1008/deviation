Instructions for building Fonts

Deviation fonts are built from BDF font files.  BDF files are bitmapped fonts that used to be commonly used by X11.  In the past Deviation fonts were built with the 'GLCD Font Creator' from MikroElectonica (for Windows).

The BDF files that ship with Deviation are built from TrueType fonts.
specificlaly the following fonts are used:
Ubuntu-Condensed
FireflySung
WenQuanYiZenHei-Mono

To build a new font:
1) Get the required inputs.  On linux, the libfreetype2 library is used
   to convert truetype to BDF.  It also requires Python and the freetype-py library:
   http://code.google.com/p/freetype-py
2) Build the BDF file:
   Here is an example for a 15px font:
   utils/build_bdf.py --size 15 --ascent 12 -b font15.bdf --ttf Ubuntu-C.ttf --ttf FireflySung.ttf --space 4
   And here is an example for a 12px font:
   utils/build_bdf.py --size 12 --ascent 10 -b font12.bdf --ttf Ubuntu-C.ttf --ttf FireflySung.ttf --space 3
3) Convert the BDF file to a Deviuation FON file:
   utils/bdf_to_font.pl -maxsize 15 -mode bin font15.bdf -out font15 -minspace 8
   utils/bdf_to_font.pl -maxsize 12 -mode bin font12.bdf -out font12 -minspace 8
   Note that 'minspace' should be tuned so thatthe reported # of ranges < 20
