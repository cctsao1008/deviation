Instructions for building Fonts

Deviation fonts are created using the 'GLCD Font Creator' from MikroElectonica (for Windows).

The Deviation characters are built from true-type fonts.  A single deviation font may utilize characters of multiple font-size.  The requirement is to find a set of characters that can fit within the required height.

For instance, Deviation's '12pt' font requires that the maximum height above the font baseline be 12 pixels, and below the baseline be 3 pixels (total height = 15)

1) Create relevant font files for each font-size:
    Open GLCD Font Creator
    File->New Font-> Import An Existing System Font
    Select a font family and style (Deviation's default font is 'Ubuntu condensed' which is an open-source font
    Select a font size
    select a minimum and maximum character range
    Disable all optimization
    Export for TFT and new GLCD
    select 'mikroC'
    copy to clipboard and paste into a file (ubuntu_narrow_10.txt for instance)

2) Repeat step (1) for each font size needed (For ubuntu narrow, we need sizes 9-12)
3) Create individual character files from each font file
    utils/convert_xglcd_to_font.pl ubuntu_narrow_10.txt -export -name ubuntu_narrow_10
    The above command will create a directory names 'ubuntu_narrow_10' with one file per character
    note that if your charcter range does not include character 65 ('A') you must specify the baseline manually.  this is done via:
        -baseline 11
    The baseline can be determined by counting pixels (from the top) in GLCD of a charcter that does not cross the baseline (any capital letter in English)
4) Repeat step(3) for each font file generated
5) Merge font directories to build final font-dir
    utils/merge_font.pl -height 15 ubuntu12 ubuntu11 ubuntu10 ubuntu9 ubuntu8
6) Build font
    utils/convert_xglcd_to_font.pl -import ubuntu12_merged -name Ubuntu_Narrow_12 -bin > src/filesystem/media/ubuntu12.fon
    utils/convert_xglcd_to_font.pl -import ubuntu12_merged -name Ubuntu_Narrow_12
