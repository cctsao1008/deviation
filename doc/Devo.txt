A 16 byte data packet is sent every 2.4msec
1.2msec after transmit, register 0x04 is checked to verify transmit status and ACK from Rx

Thye 1st byte of the data packet is one of:
0x85 - This appears to be used to transmit model data between transmitters
0x87 - Sent every 10 packets
0x8a - 
       Only sent for the 1st 10sec or so.
       1st 2 bytes indicate number of pakcets left before we stop sending 0x8a packets
       bytes 6-9 contain the cyrf6936 ID.  This is used as an XOR for 0x87, 0x8b, and 0x8c packets
       This packet is sent before every 0x8a or 0x8b packet
0x8b -
0x8c -
       0x8b and 0x8c packets are alternating packets.  I assume these are the channel data
       each packet appears to contain 4 16bit values

Packets 0x87, 0x8a, and 0x8b are 'encrypted' by xoring with the cyrf6936 id.  This is a 4 byte value.
       xoring is done by xoring the 1st 12 bytes of the packet (not including the cmd byte) as 3 dwords
       with the id.  i.e. pkt[1..4] ^ id, pkt[5-8] ^ id, pkt[9-12] ^ id
