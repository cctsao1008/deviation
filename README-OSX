The script util/build-osx.sh should download dependencies and 
build the deviation emu on Mac OS X. An Xcode installation is required.

To create a cross-compile environment, get summon-arm-toolchain from github:

git clone https://github.com/esden/summon-arm-toolchain.git

and patch it:

patch -p0 < utils/summon-arm-toolchain.patch summon-arm-toolchain

You will need macports and the following build-dependencies as well (these
instructions can also be found in the summon-arm-toolchain README
port install gmp mpfr libmpc wget libftdi

Then create a directory /usr/local/arm-none-eabi-gcc and chown it to the
user you're compiling the toolchain with. Then run the patched
summon-arm-toolchain and wait.

To build deviation, extend your PATH:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/arm-none-eabi-gcc/bin

and run make inside the src directory.

To flash the firmware to your Tx (no warranties here!), grab libusb from
http://www.libusb.org/wiki/libusb-1.0 and dfu-util from
http://dfu-util.gnumonks.org/.

Unpack, compile and install both with

./configure
make 
sudo make install

Flash devo8.dfu with

dfu-util -a 0 -D devo8.dfu
